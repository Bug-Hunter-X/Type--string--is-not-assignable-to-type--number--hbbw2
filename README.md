This repository contains a TypeScript bug and its solution. The bug involves a type error where a function expects an object with three number properties (x, y, z), but is provided with an object that only has two (x, y). The solution involves modifying the function's parameter type to accept the object with two properties. The bug demonstrates a common issue in TypeScript: type mismatches. Carefully defining types during development is important for preventing such errors.
